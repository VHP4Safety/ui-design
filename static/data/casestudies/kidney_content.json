Since the kidneys play a central role in filtering waste products, regulating electrolytes, and maintaining overall fluid balance, any drug-induced injury can significantly affect health. Evaluating kidney toxicity during drug development and treatment is crucial because as (drug-induced) kidney failure is becoming the 5<sup>th</sup> leading cause of death worldwide. Animal models do not truthfully recapitulate nor are able to predict nephrotoxicity and therefore there is a need for human-based relevant models for risk assessment.</p>"

To address this, advanced in vitro kidney models—including iPSC-derived organoids (proximal nephron), ASC-derived tubuloids (distal nephron), and organoid-derived proximal tubule cells—were used to characterize the MIE and downstream key events. Dose–response relationships were determined with LDH assays to establish IC10 and IC50 values for subsequent analyses. In proximal tubule cells, transcriptomics (bulk RNA-seq) indicated CD44 upregulation as a potential MIE, while fluorescence-based assays revealed ROS production, altered intracellular pH, disrupted mitochondrial function, and organelle changes following tacrolimus exposure. Complementary transcriptomics and immunofluorescence in iPSC-derived organoids identified dysregulated pathways, epithelial injury, fibrosis, and senescence, and analyses in ASC-derived tubuloids extended insights to distal nephron toxicity. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-edited iPSC organoids with pgp mutations were generated to mimic patient variability, enabling assessment of dose–response relationships under different pgp expression conditions.</p>"

Developing an AOP aids in the selection of relevant models that address important key events necessary to answer regulatory questions. An AOP for tacrolimus, linking tacrolimus exposure to kidney failure, has been developed by gathering and organizing scientific information from PubMed. Mechanistic evidence for KEs and KERs in this AOP primarily comes from rodent studies, immortalized kidney cell lines and limited clinical evidence. The current AOP suggests that tacrolimus exposure leads to activation of Nf-Kb and NOX, which can lead to increased ROS production and oxidative stress. Increase oxidative stress is associated with increased mitochondrial disfunction eventually resulting in metabolic impairment, aberrant TGF-B, increase in fibrosis and apoptosis in the kidney causing kidney failure. In this AOP, although the sequence of KEs is depicted linearly, we propose that the KEs of ROS production, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction are fundamentally interconnected and dynamic processes that occur simultaneously. This simultaneity complicates the assessment of whether one event precedes another or if they occur concurrently and made it impossible to identify a specific molecular initiating event.</p>"
