  - `EPS/`, `JPG/`, `PNG/`, `SVG/`: Main VHP4Safety logos in compact and long versions both with and without slogan, suitable for various branding needs.
- **brandicon/**
  - `long/` and `short/`: Brand icons in different aspect ratios and styles, with the 'long' variety used for the hero section of the landing page and the 'short' version used when square imagery suits best.
